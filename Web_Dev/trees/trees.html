<h1 id="main_headings">Summary</h1>
<div style="background-color: blue; color:aliceblue; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trees are among the most vital organisms on Earth</span>, forming the backbone
of terrestrial ecosystems and supporting life in countless ways. They
provide oxygen through photosynthesis, capturing carbon dioxide and
releasing fresh, breathable air. In doing so, trees play an essential
role in regulating the global climate, helping to moderate temperature
extremes and maintain atmospheric balance.</p>

<h1 id="main_headings">Benefits for nature</h1>
<div style="background-color: darkgreen; color:aliceblue; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;"><p>Beyond their climate benefits, trees serve as habitats for an
extraordinary diversity of species. Birds, insects, mammals, fungi, and
even other plants depend on trees for food, shelter, and nesting sites.
The complex structure of forests—from the dense canopy to the shaded
understory—creates microenvironments that nurture biodiversity. Each
layer supports organisms uniquely adapted to its specific conditions.
<br><br>
Trees also contribute to soil health. Their roots stabilize the ground,
preventing erosion and reducing the risk of landslides. Fallen leaves
and branches decompose gradually, enriching the soil with nutrients and
fostering fertile conditions for future growth. In many regions, trees
act as natural water regulators, slowing rainfall runoff, reducing
flooding, and helping replenish groundwater supplies.</p>

<h1 id="main_headings">Benefits for humans</h1>
<div class="human_text">
<p>Humans have long relied on trees for both practical and cultural
purposes. Wood is used for building, crafting tools, and creating
energy. Fruits, nuts, and sap provide food sources, while bark and
leaves have been used in traditional medicines. Across cultures, trees
hold symbolic meaning—representing strength, longevity, and renewal.
Ancient forests and monumental trees are often considered sacred,
inspiring awe and connecting communities to their natural heritage.
<br><br>
In urban areas, trees improve quality of life by offering shade,
reducing heat, and enhancing aesthetic appeal. They soften city
landscapes, create inviting public spaces, and even boost mental
well-being. Whether in bustling cities or remote wilderness, trees
remain essential allies in sustaining life and preserving the planet for
future generations.</p>
